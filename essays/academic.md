# Academic Life
In a different life I was an academic researcher in various areas of Fluid
Mechanics. You can find my research papers and academic contributions on [Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aaN_h4EAAAAJ&hl=en).

Most of my academic computing was done in Fortran 90, although in my job at
Bristol I learned and used both C++ and Python. The techniques included:
 * [Contour Dynamics and Contour Surgery](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/016779778990004X)
   but adapted for quasigeostrophic flows. I used this technique for studying
   the nonlinear interaction of vortices and waves in the ocean or atmosphere.
 * Wavelet analysis of turbulent boundary layer flows. I used the pyramid algorithm
   of Mallat for efficient computation of an orthogonal wavelet transform of the
   data. Unlike the Fourier transform, a wavelet transform maintains some
   spatial information. Hence they are suitable for examining coherent spatial
   structure at different spectral scales. 
 * I used the [Gerris](http://gerris.dalembert.upmc.fr/) solver, which includes an
   accurate model of the free surface.  I spent some time with the author,
   Stephane Popinet, when he visited Bristol University. He was very forward
   thinking for an academic programmer, and I learned about version control
   systems and object-orientation (in C, but there you go) from him.

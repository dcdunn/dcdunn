# About me

My [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-dunn-60b4385/) contains
job-related information. This page is more about my technical capabilities and
thoughts on software development.

I'm a Lead Software Development Engineer currently working at DisplayLink (UK) Ltd

One thing I have learned is that a prerequisite for designing high-quality
software systems is a test-automation capability, and a good understanding of
the hows and whys of such capabilities. I have written [some
musings](test_automation.md) on the subject.

### Academic Publications
In a different life I was an academic researcher in various areas of Fluid
Mechanics. You can find my research papers and academic contributions on [Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aaN_h4EAAAAJ&hl=en).

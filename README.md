# About me
I am a Principal Software Engineer with twenty-five years experience. My
[LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-dunn-60b4385/) contains
job-related information. This page is more about the technologies I've
developed and some of the things I've learned along the way.

Language-wise I am most experienced in
 * Modern C++, for embedded Linux, embedded RTOSes and Windows drivers and
   applications.
 * Python 3, for cloud backend services (using Flask) and for test automation.

Technology areas I have worked in include.
 * Internet-of-things: embedded software on Linux and RTOSes. Python cloud
   services. MQTT and other messaging protocols such as RabbitMQ. Data
   peristence with MongoDB. REST APIs for remote device management. 
 * USB graphics device drivers for Windows for various models: XDDM, WDDM,
   IDD. Win32 API. Windows services. Video codecs, USB communication protocols.
   Platform independent architectures for DisplayLink host drivers. All in C++.

## Essays
I have written some essays - [available here](essays/README.md) - mainly to
collect my own thoughts and pull together something readable from notes and
slideware. They are work-in-progress, but that's what a VCS is for. 

[^1]: This was for Mathematics students. It was about implementing the electric
imp's Fixed Frequency Digital-to-Analogue conversion, to enable playing of audio
through a jack on the device. It uses the [A-Law Companding
Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-law_algorithm), and de-clicking the
start signal using a sinusoidal ramp up.

[^2]: Demonstrated an IoT print device, that printed labels from text typed into
a web form on mobile phones. IMPrinter, inevitably.
